# BequestOracle
Oracle mechanics for Bequest De Cendres, instead of a traditional walkthrough, so as to preserve Roguelike characteristics.

## Initial Research
Initial research made my AI system go in the direction of a smart encyclopedia or other reference book that dynamically changes its layout and confidence scores.

## Current Developments
I'm working on seeing if I can make this work as a Roguelike game assistant for my game projects, by making it functionality like a mixture of Oracles and "Dr. Watson" like characters.

The primary goal is to make it so that they only give tips and tricks related to specific dungeon types, that draw from a common pool of symbols, descriptions, and probabilities.

## What is it trying to solve?
Traditionally walkthroughs have been something of an impossibility in Roguelike games, as procedural generation makes figuring out dungeon layouts impossible. This aims to work around that problem, by having either a wearable watch, or an oracle character be cosultable as a chracter that gives randomized tips and tricks to tackle specific vaults.
